# Conversations Powered by Cross-Lingual Knowledge

We propose the cross-lingual knowledge grounded conversation (CKGC) task that ground open-domain dialogue by cross-lingual knowledge. We collect a test collection (see [dataset](https://github.com/sunnweiwei/ckgc/tree/main/dataset)), and propose a curriculum self-knowledge distillation scheme for CKGC.
